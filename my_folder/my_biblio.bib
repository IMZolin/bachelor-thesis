abstract="Since its introduction in 1983, deconvolution microscopy has become a key image-processing tool for visualizing the cellular structures of fixed and living specimens in three dimensions and at subresolution scale. The last 20 years have seen the development of many different applications based on deconvolution microscopy, including a wide variety of optical setup and deconvolution algorithms. This chapter aims to summarize and to describe in detail the major features of this technology, from theoretical aspects to practical solutions. It will begin by explaining the principle of image formation in three-dimensional optical sectioning microscopy. As deconvolution microscopy provides, in essence, a means of overcoming the limits of optical microscopy, the second part of this chapter is dedicated to the theoretical and experimental description of image generation through a microscope. Methods will be detailed for the determination of point spread function, as a crucial step for the characterization of any optical system and a key preliminary step for image deconvolution. The challenges faced and the various possibilities for determining this function precisely will be discussed. All possible sources of aberrations and image degradation processes will be discussed. In the third part of this chapter, we will introduce the acquisition setup and requirements for compliance between acquisition and deconvolution processes. Typical setups for fixed and living cell observation will be detailed, with key features for optimizing speed and reducing artifacts. In the fourth and last part of this chapter, we will describe, in theoretical terms, the various restoration algorithms commonly used in the field of optical microscopy and will provide results obtained with some of the commercially available packages. We shall conclude by considering the prospects for future solutions (currently under development) aiming to handle more easily the huge amounts of data generated by rapid multi-dimensional living cell microscopy. Designed for use by standard cell biologists and hardware and software engineers and developers, this chapter has been written to provide a clear explanation of the wide-reaching and powerful domain of deconvolution microscopy.",

abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy imaging speed is fundamentally limited by the measurement signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To improve image SNR for a given image acquisition rate, computational denoising techniques can be used to suppress noise. However, common techniques to estimate a denoised image from a single frame either are computationally expensive or rely on simple noise statistical models. These models assume Poisson or Gaussian noise statistics, which are not appropriate for many fluorescence microscopy applications that contain quantum shot noise and electronic Johnson--Nyquist noise, therefore a mixture of Poisson and Gaussian noise. In this paper, we show convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on mixed Poisson and Gaussian noise images to overcome the limitations of existing image denoising methods. The trained CNN is presented as an open-source ImageJ plugin that performs real-time image denoising (within tens of milliseconds) with superior performance (SNR improvement) compared to conventional fluorescence microscopy denoising methods. The method is validated on external datasets with out-of-distribution noise, contrast, structure, and imaging modalities from the training data and consistently achieves high-performance (\&gt;8dB) denoising in less time than other fluorescence microscopy denoising methods.},
